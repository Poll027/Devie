## System Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-enabled GPU (recommended)
- Packages:
  - `transformers`
  - `accelerate`
  - `bitsandbytes`
  - `gradio`
  - `peft`
  - `huggingface_hub`

---

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install transformers accelerate bitsandbytes gradio peft
   ```

2. Authenticate with Hugging Face:

   ```python
   from huggingface_hub import notebook_login
   notebook_login()
   ```

3. Ensure LoRA adapters and base model paths are correctly configured:
   - **Base Model**: `unsloth/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B`
   - **LoRA Adapter**: `Poll027/my-lora-llama`

---

## How It Works

- Load the fine-tuned LLaMA model with LoRA adapters using Accelerate and BitsAndBytes for optimized inference.
- Conduct step-by-step conversation:
  1. Onboard user and gather basic profile.
  2. Suggest careers based on initial profiling.
  3. Dynamically assess traits via generated questions.
  4. Score multiple domains (Software Dev, Data Science, Cybersecurity, etc.).
  5. Recommend top 3 careers based on inferred traits and scores.

## Usage

Run the chatbot directly:

```bash
python 14_06.py
```

The Gradio web interface will launch automatically for interactive chat.
